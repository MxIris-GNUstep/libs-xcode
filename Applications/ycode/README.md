# apps-ycode

Xcode like application which combines the capabilities of gorm and projectecenter.  It's primary purpose
is to provide an interface analogous to Xcode so that we can have a more modern development IDE where 
all of the development happens in one place.  This will also help to unify our approach to dealing with
certain types of interfaces which Gorm can't easily deal with.
