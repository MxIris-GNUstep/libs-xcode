The GNUstep Xcode Library is a library for building xcode projects. 
It can be used to parse and provide information regarding an 
xcode project or used to build an xcode project directly.

1.1 License
===========

The GNUstep libraries and library resources are covered under the GNU
Lesser General Public License.  This means you can use these libraries 
in any program (even non-free programs). If you distribute the libraries 
along with your program, you must make the improvements you have made to 
the libraries freely available. You should read the COPYING.LIB file for
more information. 

1.2 How to use
==============

To use this library you need to build it and install it and then compile
the front-end which is in tools-buildtool.  Simply go into a directory
which contains an Xcode project and type buildtool and it should build
the project.  If it doesn't then submit a bug.  Currently GNUstep can
only build projects for macOS.

1.3 How can you help?
=====================

   * Give us feedback!  Tell us what you like; tell us what you think
     could be better.

     Please log bug reports on the GNUstep project page
     `https://github.com/gnustep/libs-xcode/issues` or send bug reports
     to <bug-gnustep@gnu.org>.


     Happy hacking!
